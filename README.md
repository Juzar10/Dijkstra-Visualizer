# Dijkstra-Visualizer

It is a Dijkstra Algorithm implemented in a simple grid layout with vanila javascript and plain css.

This project is created to help student give visual aid on how Dijkstra works and how dijktra adapts to Object(wall) on the path.

## Installation

1.Clone or Download zip file

2.Open index.html file in your browser.

## How to Use

there are two pointers start and end pointer.you can drag those to any location there are walls you can draw in-between to force path some way.
then click on the start algorithm button and it will animate the path and search option. you can also use speed slider to adjust the speed of algorithm.

Note: walls have weight of infinity so there is no weighted Dijkstra implementation.
